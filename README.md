Hello, this is Amirhossein Mohammadi and this is a twitter clone project.

this repo is about cloning twitter and I almost code it from youtube video.

In this project I use next-js but honestly it was just an easy training and it wasn’t too helpful.

Actually it was just my first project with next and tailwind and it was a good training for basic features like Routing or something like them.

Of course it was a good training for ui coding and frontend stuff.
